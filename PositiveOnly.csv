"I booked a room for an overnight stay with a friend including a breakfast buffet and I swear this place is worth every riyal you pay Lovely and very efficient service staff (the guest relation manager even gave me a call the night before we check in to ask if I have extra requests, if I need this or that,etc) HUGE fancy room (I'm in love with the bathroom ), great amenities, affordable restaurants (ok a little bit pricey but I mean the servings come in large portions and so delish), the entire place is immaculately clean, and it's as if you are not in Doha this place takes you away from the hustle and bustle of city life. At one point I even thought I'm back in my home country  This island has got a wellness center, diving center, bowling alley, tennis court, golf course, a cinema, several restaurants, regular pools, surf pool, private villas and rooms on stilts (which is off limits to other guests unless you are staying in that part of the island. it is in fact guarded). You can also rent a bike to go around the island although there are golf carts that can take you around for free. You just have to ask from the reception desk.  and oh One thing I find quite unique about this resort is that instead of giving you a refreshing towel when you arrive, they pour rose water on your hands awesome And yeah they even handed guests with a gift - assorted sweets in the island's signature yellow box  this place? I'm coming back soon for sure",Maria Carillo,10,8.3,Maria Carillo,9.15,"Dear Maria, Warm greetings from Banana Island Resort and thank you for sharing your experiences with us and the entire Booking com community!

"I was very satisfied with my stay I was staying at a local AirBnB before checking in which happened to be more expensive and a lot less comfortable After finding this place, I quickly checked out of the AirBnB and checked into Red Planet Prior to doing so, I read a lot of the reviews, hoping I knew what I was going to expect I saw some reviews stating the staff was not professional The hotel responded to these comments saying they would look into it, and I assume they did because the staff was lovely during my stay! The place was under construction, which didn't bother me, and o was informed of prior to staying, but it would have been nice if there was a place to sit and read a book or use a laptop The only place to do this was on the red benches which weren't comfortable The room itself was cozy and comfortable Keep in mind, it is tiny There is not closet, rather a bar to hang clothes and a table that folds down from the wall to put clothes This was slightly inconvenient but once I unpacked and put my suitcase away, it wasn't an issue If you're traveling with a lot of bags, you may have a space problem Apart from the size the room was perfect Very comfortable bed with clean sheets and new clean towels everyday The bathroom was great and the shower was so good I ended up taking about three showers a day, just because it was so lovely The security was good, they helped me with my luggage when leaving and always held the door open I recommend buying big water bottles in the local 7-11 and storing them in your room My other recommendation is to put the shower mat to the side of the shower entrance, as opposed to in front of it, since water seeps onto the floor and soaks the towel - It dries rather quickly though I wasn't too happy with the attached restaurant, they always seemed to be out of stock from of the few meal choices I wanted to try and they weren't accommodating when I asked to substitute sides",Samuel,10,7.11,Samuel,8.55,"Warm Greetings from Red Planet Hotel Mr. Samuel, Thank you so much for posting a review.

"The location was fabulous as the hotel is actually in the airport We booked the Sleep, Park and Fly package which was $265 for one night stay with 7 days of covered self-parking nearby Being older without the energy of younger people, we enjoyed being able to park the night of our arrival, then check out the next morning and walk just a few feet to the airline desks We fly non-rev (standby) with flight benefits from our son's job, so we are never sure if we will get on a flight The hotel staff were all so helpful and encouraging When we had to stay another night, they gave us the same room and some in and out parking tickets so we could go to a restaurant and a few places in fun Grapevine while we waited until the next afternoon to depart We decided to extend our visit with a new granddaughter in Frankfurt, Germany and the hotel staff said we could conveniently leave our car in the parking area for any additional nights at $2495, which was the airport price for that nearby parking place All in all, this is a great package in a fabulously luxuriant hotel with a cloud-soft bed and towels and friendly, professional staff We will be staying here again",Carolina,10,9,Carolina,9.5,"Dear Carolina Moon,  many thanks for taking the time to describe and rate your experieneces.
